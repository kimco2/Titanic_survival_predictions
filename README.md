# Predicting who survived the Titanic

dashboards available:
https://kimco2.github.io/who_survived_the_titanic/


### **Purpose**
Analyse the titanic dataset and create an algorithm that predicts which passengers survived.

### **Data source**
The complete titanic dataset available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3) will be used.  It includes a total of 1309 passengers.

### **Objectives**
- Understand the composition of passengers and the composition of those who survived relative to those who died.
- Use supervised learning to create a classification model to predict which passengers survived.

### **High level overview**
1. Data available in xls format
2. Clean and manipulate data in python
3. Create supervised learning classification models and optimise them. Currently thinking about:
    - logistic regression - would like to try PCA if appropriate
    - random forest
4. Save relevant fields to a csv file
5. Upload csv file into tableau to create dashboards
6. Create a web page by saving links to the dashboards in an html file
7. Create a presentation focusing on the technical aspects of the project
