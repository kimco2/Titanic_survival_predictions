### **Purpose**
Analyse the Titanic dataset and use supervised machine learning to create a classification model that predicts which passengers survived.

- Dashboards can be [viewed online](https://kimco2.github.io/who_survived_the_titanic/)

### **Folder structure**
The main folder contains:
- **Titantic_data_setup.ipynb** - code and charts created in cleaning and exploring the data
- **entity_relationship_diagram.png** - an image of the sql table structure
- **table_schemata.sql** - code used for creating the database in postgresql
- **Titanic_logistic_regression.ipynb** - logistic regression models including optimisations made
- **Titanic_random_forest.ipynb** - random forest models including optimisations made
- **index.html** - code used to create the webpage 
- **Tableau_dashboard.twb** - dashboards that were created in tableau

The folder **data_files** contains the initial data file used, as well as additional data files created after cleaning to use in sql and tableau.
