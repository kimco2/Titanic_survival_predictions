# Predicting who survived the Titanic

### **Purpose**
Analyse the Titanic dataset and use supervised machine learning to create a classification model that predicts which passengers survived.

### **Data source**
The complete titanic dataset available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3) was used.  It includes a total of 1309 passengers.

### **Aspects covered**
- Cleaning data in python
- Exploratory data analysis
- Creating a database in SQL and loading data into it
- Connecting to SQL database in Python
- Running logistic regression and machine learning on the data to create a classification model that predicts survivors
- Using Tableau to create a dashboard, saving it to a webpage via HTML and git-hub pages

### **Web page**
- A report is saved in the main folder as **Predicting_who_survived.pdf**
- Dashboards can be [viewed online](https://kimco2.github.io/who_survived_the_titanic/)

### **Report**
- A report is saved in the main folder as **Predicting_who_survived.pdf**

### **Folder structure**
The main folder contains:
- **Titantic_data_setup.ipynb** - code and charts created in cleaning and exploring the data
- **entity_relationship_diagram.png** - an image of the sql table structure
- **table_schemata.sql** - code used for creating the database in postgresql
- **Titanic_logistic_regression.ipynb** - logistic regression models including optimisations made
- **Titanic_random_forest.ipynb** - random forest models including optimisations made
- **index.html** - code used to create the webpage 
- **Tableau_dashboard.twb** - dashboards that were created in tableau

The folder **data_files** contains the initial data file used, as well as additional data files created after cleaning to use in sql and tableau.
